    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about-us">A health care center is a facility that provides comprehensive medical services to
        individuals and communities. It typically offers a range of services including primary care, preventive
        care, diagnostics, treatment, and rehabilitation. Staffed by healthcare professionals such as doctors,
        nurses, and specialists, these centers aim to address both acute and chronic medical conditions.

        Health care centers often provide vaccinations, screenings, and health education to promote wellness and
        prevent diseases. Many centers also offer specialized services like maternity care, pediatric care,
        mental health support, and management of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. Some
        health care centers are equipped with laboratories and imaging services for thorough diagnostics.

        Patients can access urgent care for non-life-threatening emergencies, reducing the need for hospital
        visits. Health care centers play a vital role in community health by offering accessible and affordable
        care, often supported by government programs or non-profit organizations. They are crucial in
        underserved areas, providing essential health services to populations that might otherwise have limited
        access to care.
